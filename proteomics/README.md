Since chr8q gain is associated with high-grade transformation in MPNST and 
inferior overall survival, we integrate multi-omics data to understand drivers 
and potential targets based on chr8q status. To do this, we collected new 
proteomics data and ran correlations between omics expression and chr8q copy
number in MPNST patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in addition to pathway 
analyses, network analyses, drug sensitivity predictions, fluorescent in situ
hybridization, and viability studies

# Proteomics analysis 

This folder contains the anlaysis for the proteomics analysis for the MPNST
Chromosome 8 analysis supported by the DOD NFRP.

## Proteomics raw data
The [proteomics])(./proteomics) folder contains the processing of the proteins 


## Chr8 correlation analysis
